  2. Instantly online using [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).


### Option 1: Run Locally (VS Code + Anaconda)

  1. Clone the repository to your local machine: <br>
  ```git clone https://github.com/Eilis9/WSAA-coursework.git```
  ```cd WSAA-coursework```
  2. Set up a virtual environment using Anaconda: <br>

  ```conda activate wsaa_assignment``` <br>
  ``` pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br>
  3. Launch Visual Studio Code (VS Code) <br>
    - Open the repository folder in VS Code
    - Install the Python extension if prompted
    - Select the wsaa_assignment environment as the Python interpreter
  4. Run the Jupyter Notebooks: <br>
